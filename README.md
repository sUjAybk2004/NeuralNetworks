# MiniProjects

This repository contains several Jupyter Notebook mini-projects focused on machine learning concepts and implementations.

## Project Overview

1. **BiasAndVariance.ipynb**  
   - Explores the trade-off between bias and variance in machine learning models.
   - Includes visualizations and examples to illustrate underfitting and overfitting.

2. **BinaryHandwritten.ipynb**  
   - Implements a binary classification model for handwritten digit recognition.
   - Focuses on recognizing two specific digits from the dataset.

3. **MulticlassHandwritten.ipynb**  
   - Extends the handwritten digit recognition task to a multi-class setting.
   - Trains and evaluates a model to classify all digits in the dataset.

4. **MushroomDecisionTrees.ipynb**  
   - Uses decision tree algorithms to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.
   - Features exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.

## Folder Structure

- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`  
  - Automatically generated checkpoints for Jupyter Notebooks.

- `*.ipynb`  
  - Contains the primary code for each mini-project.
